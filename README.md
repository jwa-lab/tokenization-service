# Tokenization Service

Service for CRUD operations on NFTs using a user-friendly interface

## What is it?

Provides an easy to use API (REST-like or message-based) that triggers calls to a dApp.
The current implementation is a Node.js server using `@taquito` to translate `NATS.io` messages into calls to the [Tezos Smart Contract]
Reads are often performed on a Tezos indexer instead of running a Smart Contract function.

## How to setup Dev environment:

1. Start a minilab locally: https://github.com/jwa-lab/minilab
2. Install this service's contract: https://github.com/jwa-lab/tokenization-service-contracts
3. Then build this service

```
./run build
```

To run the service, you need to locate the newly deployed contract's KT1 address:

```
# After deploying the smart contract, find the Kt1 address here:

```

And edit the `./run` script, set `WAREHOUSE_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=KT1RedbZ6vuAgTqBeJMiHGcvhkMLCUBKVGN9`

```
./run start
```

### Develop

To run this service in `develop` mode, simply run 

```
./run dev
```

This will run a `nodemon` checking when files change and automatically restarting the recompiled Typescript sources.


### Test

To test this service, follow the steps listed in `How to setup Dev environment`

Then:

```
node tests/test.js
```

It should create a new item and output it back after creation.
